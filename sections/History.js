      Nicola and Joel owe a great debt of thankfulness to Eastern Europeans where they lived and ministered for
      over thirty years. Nicola’s family owes a debt to the Czechs. Her family lived in a house in Wimbledon,
      southwest London, England during World War 2. Nightly, the German air force bombed London and the residents
      slept in the Underground metro tunnels or concrete bunkers in their gardens. One night, Kath, her mother,
      despaired of sleeping in the cold bunker, and she just wanted to sleep in her own bed. That night, 6 one
      ton bombs landed on her street but didn’t explode! The army said they were sabotaged with sand instead of
      explosives at the Skoda munitions factory near Prague! Ten years later, Nicola was born.

      Joel had just received Christ as personal Savior just before starting college to study medicine near Chicago.
      At college, Joel met a fellow medical student, Lidija Jovanovic, from a Yugoslav family (with a Montenegrine name).
      Lidija explained the fullness of the Holy Spirit and took him to her Full Gospel Church in Chicago where Joel had a
      glorious supernatural baptism of the Holy Spirit (
      <ExternalLink href="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Acts-Chapter-8/#12">
        Acts 8:12-17
      </ExternalLink>
      ). In the former Yugoslavia, there is a lot of religious Christianity but unfortunately very little experience with
      the Holy Spirit! Joel feels a debt of thankfulness to help bless the people of the former Yugoslavia.

      Joel felt the “strength” of salvation (
      <ExternalLink href="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Romans-Chapter-5/#6">
        Rom. 5:6
      </ExternalLink>
      ), but was soon impressed by the Holy Spirit that there was more “power” to live for Christ and help others (
      <ExternalLink href="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Acts-Chapter-1/#8">
        Acts 1:8
      </ExternalLink>
      ). The 12 disciples were saved as they saw the risen Christ on that first Resurrection Sunday evening. They believed,
      and received the Holy Spirit “inside” them (
      <ExternalLink href="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/John-Chapter-20/#22">
        Jn. 20:22
      </ExternalLink>). However, Jesus still commanded them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait another 47 days for the
      outpouring of the Holy Spirit to come “upon” them (
      <ExternalLink href="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Acts-Chapter-1/#3s">
        Acts 1:3-8
      </ExternalLink>
      ). See his study notes on the “30 contrasts between the two main experiences with the Holy Spirit”. Come to Jesus
      and get everything He paid for you to have as soon as possible!
